/*
 * Programmable Interval Timer (PIT) Driver Implementation
 *
 * This file implements the Intel 8253/8254 PIT configuration and control:
 * - Supports all 3 PIT channels (0-2):
 *   - Channel 0: System timer (default 100Hz)
 *   - Channel 1: DRAM refresh (legacy)
 *   - Channel 2: PC speaker control
 * - Configurable frequency per channel (1Hz to 1.193182MHz)
 * - Square wave generation mode (mode 3)
 * - Uses standard PIT base frequency of 1.193182 MHz
 * - 16-bit counter per channel
 * - Interrupt generation on channel 0 (IRQ0)
