# cupid-os
A modern, 32-bit operating system written in C and x86 Assembly that combines clean design with nostalgic aesthetics. This project implements core OS functionality including:

- Custom bootloader with protected mode transition
- Comprehensive interrupt handling system
- Advanced PS/2 keyboard driver with full US layout support
- High-precision programmable timer system
- VGA text mode graphics with custom character rendering

The goal of cupid-os is to create an accessible, well-documented operating system that serves as both a learning platform and a foundation for experimental OS concepts. Drawing inspiration from TempleOS, OsakaOS, and classic game systems, it focuses on combining technical excellence with an engaging user experience.

## Philosophy
cupid-os embraces a philosophy of complete user empowerment and transparency, inspired by TempleOS. Like TempleOS, cupid-os gives users full, unrestricted access to the entire system:

- No security boundaries or privilege levels - all code runs in ring 0
- Direct hardware access from user programs
- Full memory access with no virtual memory restrictions
- Complete visibility into and control over all system internals
- No artificial limitations or "protections" getting in the way

The goal is to create a pure, simple environment where users have complete freedom to explore, experiment, and truly understand how their computer works at the lowest level. While this approach sacrifices security and isolation, it maximizes learning potential and enables direct hardware manipulation that modern OSes restrict.

This design choice reflects our belief that users should be trusted and empowered rather than constrained. For educational and experimental purposes, having full access to bare metal is invaluable.
