# cupid-os
A modern, 32-bit operating system written in C and x86 Assembly that combines clean design with nostalgic aesthetics. The project implements core OS functionality while serving as both a learning platform and a foundation for experimental OS concepts. Inspired by systems like TempleOS and OsakaOS, cupid-os aims to provide a transparent, hands-on environment where users can directly interact with hardware.

## Example of cupid-os
![alt text for cupid-os img](img/basic_shell.png)

- Custom bootloader with protected mode transition
- Comprehensive interrupt handling system
- Advanced PS/2 keyboard driver with full US layout support
- High-precision programmable timer system
- VGA text mode graphics with custom character rendering

The goal of cupid-os is to create an accessible, well-documented operating system that serves as both a learning platform and a foundation for experimental OS concepts. Drawing inspiration from TempleOS, OsakaOS, and classic game systems, it focuses on combining technical excellence with an engaging user experience.

## Philosophy
cupid-os embraces a philosophy of complete user empowerment and transparency, inspired by TempleOS. Like TempleOS, cupid-os gives users full, unrestricted access to the entire system:

- No security boundaries or privilege levels - all code runs in ring 0
- Direct hardware access from user programs
- Full memory access with no virtual memory restrictions
- Complete visibility into and control over all system internals
- No artificial limitations or "protections" getting in the way

The goal is to create a pure, simple environment where users have complete freedom to explore, experiment, and truly understand how their computer works at the lowest level. While this approach sacrifices security and isolation, it maximizes learning potential and enables direct hardware manipulation that modern OSes restrict.

This design choice reflects our belief that users should be trusted and empowered rather than constrained. For educational and experimental purposes, having full access to bare metal is invaluable.

## Project Structure

- **boot/**  
  - **`boot.asm`** â€“ The bootloader that runs at 0x7C00. It displays an initial boot message, loads the kernel from disk, sets up the initial environment, and transitions from 16â€‘bit real mode to 32â€‘bit protected mode.

- **kernel/**  
  - **`kernel.c`** â€“ The main kernel file responsible for initializing the VGA, setting up the system (IDT, PIC, timer, keyboard, filesystem), calibrating the CPU timer using the TSC, and entering the shell loop.
  - **`idt.c/h`** â€“ IDT setup and gate configuration, including exception and IRQ stubs.
  - **`isr.asm`** â€“ Assembly routines providing common ISR/IRQ stubs that save processor state and call Câ€‘handlers.
  - **`irq.c/h`** â€“ IRQ handler dispatch and registration functions.
  - **`pic.c/h`** â€“ PIC initialization, remapping, and masking/unmasking functions.
  - **`math.c/h`** â€“ Math utilities including 64â€‘bit division (`udiv64`), integer-to-string conversion (`itoa`), and hexadecimal printing.
  - **`shell.c/h`** â€“ A basic commandâ€‘line shell that parses user input and supports commands like `echo`, `mkdir`, `ls`, `cd`, and `pwd`.
  - **`string.c/h`** â€“ Standard string manipulation functions (`strlen`, `strcmp`, `strcpy`, `strncpy`, etc.).
  - **`cpu.h`** â€“ CPU utilities including an inline `rdtsc()` for highâ€‘precision timing and CPU frequency detection.
  - **`kernel.h`** â€“ Core kernel definitions and shared globals (e.g., VGA parameters, boot constants).

  - **`keyboard.c/h`** â€“ The PS/2 keyboard driver with:
    - Full US keyboard layout support
    - Interruptâ€‘driven input (IRQ1)
    - Detailed handling of modifier keys (Shift, Ctrl, Alt, Caps Lock) and extended keys (arrow keys, delete)
    - Circular buffer implementation for key event storage and configurable key repeat/debouncing
  - **`timer.c/h`** â€“ Timer routines that configure the Intel 8253/8254 PIT:
    - System tick counter and sleep/delay functions (both millisecond and microsecond delays via TSC busyâ€‘wait)
    - Multiâ€‘channel support with callback registration for additional timer events
    - CPU calibration to determine frequency via the TSC
  - **`pit.c/h`** â€“ Functions to program the PIT for squareâ€‘wave generation and configurable frequencies.
  - **`speaker.c/h`** â€“ PC speaker driver offering functions to:
    - Turn the speaker on/off at a specified frequency
    - Play simple beeps and tones (note: the test routine is disabled to prevent interference with the keyboard driver)

- **filesystem/**  
  - **`fs.c/h`** â€“ A basic filesystem module supporting file and directory creation, listing, and management.
  - **`path.c/h`** â€“ Path resolution functions, including support for absolute and relative paths and maintaining the current working directory.
