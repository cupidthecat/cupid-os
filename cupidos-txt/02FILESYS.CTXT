>h2 Mount Layout
CupidOS initializes these mounts:

/      -> ramfs
/dev   -> devfs
/home  -> fat16 (if ATA disk is present and FAT16 init succeeds)

>h2 Standard Directories Created At Boot
/bin
/tmp
/home

>h2 RAMFS VS FAT16
RAMFS (/):
- In-memory, non-persistent
- Good for temporary runtime files in current session
- /bin is populated at boot with built-in stubs and embedded .cc command files

FAT16 (/home):
- Persistent disk-backed storage (disk image / real disk)
- Intended for user files and user programs
- Mounted via VFS FAT16 wrapper

DEVFS (/dev):
- Device filesystem mount

>h2 In-Memory File Table (Legacy Static Files)
Kernel static fs entries currently include:
- LICENSE.txt
- MOTD.txt

They are loaded into ramfs during boot.

>h2 FAT16 Driver Reality (Current Implementation)
Implemented:
- FAT16 partition detection from MBR (first matching FAT16 partition type)
- File open/read/close
- File create/write/overwrite
- File delete
- Root directory enumeration
- Root-level directory create (mkdir)
- Subdirectory enumeration for directories directly under FAT16 root

Important practical limitations:
- 8.3 naming model is enforced by FAT filename conversion routines.
- Wrapper still behaves mostly like flat root for file opens/writes.
- Creating files inside subdirectories through VFS path "dir/file.txt"
  is not a reliable workflow yet.
- Best-supported workflow today: keep user files and scripts in /home root,
  and user command sources in /home/bin.

>h2 Write Path Details
FAT16 VFS write path buffers output and rewrites whole file on close.
If write fails, rollback attempts to restore original content.

>h2 Block Cache
Disk I/O goes through block cache.
Useful commands:
- sync       : flush cache now
- cachestats : print cache hit/miss statistics

>h2 Persistent Program Workflow
Place custom command sources in:
  /home/bin/<name>.cc
Then run:
  <name>
Shell auto-discovers and JIT-compiles from /home/bin.

>h2 Path Safety Tips
- Use absolute paths when learning:
    /home/myfile.txt
    /tmp/test.txt
- Use pwd frequently.
- Verify with:
    ls
    cat
    mount

>h2 Where To Put These Doc Files In A Live System
If you want docs readable inside running CupidOS:
- Put copies in /home (persistent) or /tmp (session only).
- /home is recommended for long-term docs.
