This folder is a source-verified documentation set for users inside CupidOS.
It focuses on what is implemented now, not just planned wiki features.

>h2 What Is Important To Know First
1) The shell is command-dispatch driven:
   - Built-ins handle compiler/scripting/GUI launch commands.
   - Most day-to-day commands come from /bin/*.cc and are JIT-compiled.

2) Filesystems are split:
   - /      = ramfs (in-memory, non-persistent)
   - /dev   = devfs
   - /home  = FAT16 disk (persistent if disk image is used)

3) CupidScript and CupidC are different:
   - CupidScript (.cup): interpreted shell scripting language.
   - CupidC (.cc): custom C-like language compiled inside CupidOS.
   - ELF C programs are a third path (see 05ELFPROG.TXT).

4) Some wiki pages are ahead of implementation:
   - This docs set calls out current limitations where relevant.
